In this project I used different regression algorithms to predict sales of stores. I used Kaggles free GPUs and Datasets in this competion. Those different algorithms include random forrest, decision tree, xgboost, K Nearest Neighbour and so on. Initially I used feature engineering to get my data into the best shape.
